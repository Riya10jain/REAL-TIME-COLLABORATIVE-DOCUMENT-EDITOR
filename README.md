# Final Submission — Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor

## Project Summary (what this submission contains)
This repository contains a complete implementation of a **Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor** that satisfies the project requirements: it uses **React.js** for a dynamic and responsive front-end UI, **Node.js (Express + Socket.io)** as the real-time backend server, and **MongoDB** for persistent storage. The editor supports rich-text editing using **Quill.js** and synchronizes changes between multiple users in real time using Quill delta operations relayed through Socket.io. Document content is periodically auto-saved to MongoDB as Quill delta JSON, allowing documents to be loaded and resumed later.

This submission is intended as a final deliverable for an internship or college assignment. It includes a clear project structure, setup instructions, and a short technical write-up explaining design choices and limitations. Everything required to run the project locally is included, and the README below explains how to run, test, and extend the project.

## Why these technologies?
- **React.js**: React provides a component-based architecture that makes building interactive, responsive user interfaces straightforward. It pairs well with rich-text editor libraries and real-time event handling.
- **Quill.js**: Quill is a mature, modular rich-text editor that exposes a delta format for edits. Using Quill simplifies handling formatting (bold, italic, lists, links, images), and its delta model is ideal for transmitting incremental changes in collaborative applications.
- **Node.js + Socket.io**: Node.js is well-suited for WebSocket-style real-time applications. Socket.io provides a robust abstraction over WebSocket and fallback transports, and makes room-based messaging simple, which we use to isolate document sessions.
- **MongoDB**: Stores Quill delta JSON per document. MongoDB’s flexible document model matches well with the JSON-based delta format and simplifies rapid prototyping and iteration.

## Features included
1. **Create/Open Document**: Create a new document via the frontend, which returns a document ID. Paste an existing ID to open a document saved earlier.
2. **Rich-Text Editing**: Formatting options such as headings, bold, italic, lists, links, and image embedding (via Quill toolbar) are available.
3. **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users can open the same document ID; local delta changes are emitted to the server and broadcast to other connected clients in the same document room.
4. **Auto-Save**: The client auto-saves the full document delta to the server every 5 seconds. The server persists this to MongoDB.
5. **Responsive UI**: Tailwind CSS (via CDN in the prototype) is used for a clean responsive interface suitable for desktop or tablet use.
6. **Clear Code Structure**: A separated frontend and backend folder structure with `package.json` files and a Mongoose model for Document.

## How to run (local development)
**Prerequisites:** Node.js (v16+), npm, MongoDB (local `mongod` or Atlas connection).
1. Start MongoDB locally by running `mongod` or create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and obtain your connection string.
2. Backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and set MONGO_URI if using Atlas
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   Backend listens on port `4000` by default.
3. Frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   Frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.
4. Open the frontend, create a new document, copy the ID, and open the same URL or another browser tab to collaborate.

## File / Folder Overview
- `backend/server.js` — Express server and Socket.io logic (handles `join-document`, `send-changes`, `receive-changes`, and `save-document` events).
- `backend/models/Document.js` — Mongoose schema: stores `title` and `content` (Quill delta JSON string).
- `frontend/src/App.js` — Main UI and document creation/opening UI.
- `frontend/src/components/Editor.js` — React-Quill integration and Socket.io client logic.
- `frontend/public/index.html` — Includes Tailwind CDN and Quill CSS for a simple, polished UI.
- `README.md` — This file (final submission explanation).

## Limitations & Next Steps (for improvements)
- **Conflict resolution / concurrency**: This prototype relays Quill deltas between clients and relies on Quill's internal handling for merging deltas. For production-level collaboration with robust conflict resolution, consider using an OT or CRDT framework such as **ShareDB**, **Yjs**, or **Automerge**. These libraries provide more rigorous guarantees about eventual consistency, undo/redo across clients, and history management.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Currently the editor allows anyone with a document ID to join. Add JWT-based authentication, access-control lists, and invitation links for secure sharing in real projects.
- **Presence & Cursors**: Show live cursors and user presence (who is editing) to improve UX — this can be implemented by broadcasting cursor positions and assigned user colors.
- **Scalability**: Socket.io rooms work well for small to medium scale. For large-scale real-time collaboration, integrate Redis (as socket adapter) and deploy multiple backend instances behind a load balancer.
- **Image hosting**: Quill can embed images as base64; using a file upload and object storage (S3) plus image CDN is better for large images.

## Submission notes (what to hand in)
- Zip the repository folder (`collaborative-document-editor/`) and submit the ZIP. The ZIP in this deliverable is named `final-collab-editor.zip` (download link provided separately).
- Include this README in the ZIP as part of the project report. You may copy & paste sections of this README into your internship report or submission portal as needed.

## Contact & Support
If you need me to:
- Add authentication and user cursors;
- Dockerize the stack with `docker-compose` for easy running;
- Integrate ShareDB or Yjs for robust OT/CRDT collaboration;
- Produce a short video demo or screenshots for the submission;
I can implement any of those next — tell me which one you prefer and I’ll add it to the project files.
